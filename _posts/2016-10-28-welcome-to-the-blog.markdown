description: A welcome to my blog

I have taken part in many outdoor pastimes and sports over the years and a move to the South Coast (New Forest) and the kids getting a bit older have enabled a whole new world of getting outside.  
Shortly after we moved I discovered I had a high blood pressure problem. Something I discovered was pretty standard for 40 somthing desk bound guys.
A large and permanent lifestyle change in diet and ethos was required.

The year started with a new gang to go cycling with in the road we had moved to.  This cycling is a little bit nuts.  Every Wednesday evening we meet at 8pm and head out into the forest. 20 miles later we reward ourselves with a trip to the pub to replace some of the lost calories.  Some of these rides are legendary.  

In January after avoiding running for many years I started the OS runners led 5k to 10k.  I felt I was ok with 5 but even that was a bit of a stretch.  After ten weeks I ran the 10k but more importantly a went out into the forest at home and ran 20K and really enjoyed.  I read up a lot about running and started to help friends and family with running styles and nutrition.

At about the same time OS asked for applicants to compete in the Dell Management Challenge.  I have to admit I told a bit of a white lie with my 5K and 10K times but I made it onto the team.  We duly competed in October and it was one of the best things I have ever done.  It has inspired me to get outside and enjoy it even more.  

The Dell is and expensive thing to compete in but there are many opportunities to #getoutside.

So I have set myself the task of blogging and inspiring others as well as enabling myself to be out there doing it.  And all the while I will have to run the normal life with family and employment responsibilities.

My plan with the Dell as I will probably not be able to return for a few years is to attend an Advanced outdoor first aid course and return as a volunteer next year.  Hopefully as a roving cycle based first aider out on the course with the @thecarbonmonkey.  But first off I have to run with my sisterâ€™s cows to move them to fresh pastures.
