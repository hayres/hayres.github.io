Day 2 of the [Vendee Globe](http://www.vendeeglobe.org/en){:target="_blank"} and Brit [Alex Thomson](http://www.alexthomsonracing.com/) has taking what could be a massive punt to 
go inshore and get the breeze for longer on the way down the Portugal coast.  
This could be a race winning move that puts him in the next weather system ahead of his rivals.  
Unusual to see such a bold move amongst the leaders who tend to mark each other these days. 

Bon Vent Alex.
