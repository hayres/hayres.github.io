For many this is the future that they have been waiting for.  Autonomous cars are going to be here soon. In fact if you buy a Tesla it has a certain amount already.
But now Amazon are advertising Amazon Go.  A store where you can walk in, pick what you want and walk out.

_"A store where you can walk in, pick what you want and walk out."_

No checkouts, no queues etc etc etc.

Amazing, this is really futuristic and my brain started asking, how is it going to do that then.

So i done some searching on the internet to find out if there was much info out there.  Plenty of people were taking a best guess.
