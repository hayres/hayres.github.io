Long Distance Single handed offshore racing is boring, **said no one EVER!!**

As of the 1700UTC sched report [Alex](http://www.alexthomsonracing.com/) continues to eat away at the gap to the lead pair 
and still shows consistently faster speeds than the rest of the fleet.
A further 5 mile cut in the lead in 3 hours.  Keep this up and in 24 hours he will be within site of their stern lights.  In fact he will be in second place.

This is no slowly slowly catchy monkey.  This is a Nelson like "Nevermind about maneuvers, go straight at 'em'"
 
Enda Oâ€™Coineen has also taken a place.  He is running deep with more wind than the rest of the fleet.
