The blog post I always wanted to make.


I've just ordered Bonnie Tyler's Goalkeeping Blunders Vol 2.   
It's just totally clips of Joe Hart.  


I bumped into Bonnie Tyler in that London.  She said shall we go for a coffee?  
I said Starbucks?  She said no.  
I said Costa?  She said no.  
I think she was holding out for a nero!


I bought a Bonnie Tyler sat nav  
It's rubbish  
It keeps telling me to turn around, then every now and then it falls apart!



I came home from work one day and there was a blond haired woman tiling my kitchen singing her heart out  
Ah I thought, that's a Bonnie Tyler!
