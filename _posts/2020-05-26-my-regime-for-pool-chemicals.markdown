A lot of friends have bought temporary pools and hot tubs because of cancelled holidays,
 and a few have asked me what my chemical regime looks like, so I thought I would write it down. 

I stick to chlorine granules to shock the pool when it is first filled and once every couple of weeks I use double 
the normal amount the instructions tell you for the litres of water that you have.  This must be carefully dissolved before being added to the pool.
If you don't know the volume of your pool the calculation is pi x Radius<sup>2</sup> x Height.

To make the daily grind easy I use a floating dispenser with chlorine tablets.  
I test every day until I know that I have the release of chemicals at the correct rate then test 2 or 3 times a week. 
I use the pH+ and pH- when the testing kit indicates that the pH levels are out of the correct range.

The Spa is sightly harder as the hotter water tend to change more dramatically than the pool.
It also requires more chlorine as it evaporates off a lot quicker
So ours is a Bestway Palm Springs and to make it easy I have a 5ml teaspoon catering measure which I can just spoon in the required amount (25ml). 
Then as I keep mine at 40Â° I run the air pump for 5 minutes to dissolve the granules.
Again I move after it is settled to testing 2 or 3 times a week.

You should with care be able to make the water in the spa last about 6 weeks.  

We have a couple of hard and fast rules to avoid the water getting ruined too quickly.

 - No suntan lotions.  One child smeared with factor 50 and your water will be milky and have to be changed.  The higher heat melts the lotion off the body.
 - Likewise, no body-lotions and try to avoid hair product like gels or waxes going in the water.
 - Its best if all people taking part have a shower beforehand.  There is a reason they aske you to do this in commercial spas.
 - I avoid clarifiers and foam reducers in the spa.  The lead to scum on the surface and can end up with milky water.
 - Bestway heater pumps can be cleaned with a device that attaches a chamber to the in and out. It is worth descaling your pump once a year.
 - I shook the spa once a week and as mentioned change the water every  6 weeks or so.
 
 I have been using a variety of different testing strips over the last 4 years 
 but am now thinking of upgrading to a testing kit where you add reagents to a sample of pool water to get the Chlorine ph and Alkalinity levels.  
 I have found that test strips can be hit-and-miss and two different brands can give different results. 
 Disregarding the purchase of the test kit thi option will cost about 14 per test whereas the test strips can be up to 25p.
 
 Finally, here are a couple of tips for keeping the pool temperature up.
 Use a solar cover.  The really do work.  The keep the warmth in by laying flat on the water and preventing evaporation, and the air bubbles create a barrie to stop heat transfer. 
 I also use another cover over the top of that which ties on and provides another air gap. 
 I did not think it would make much of a difference but tests have shown that the water temperature falls less overnight with that cover on. 
 When you are not heating the pool don't run the pump.  
 If you have a powerful pump that will circulate your pool water in as little as 2 hours there is no need to run the pump after this if you are not heating the pool water.
 Once the heater is off then continuing to circulate the water just cools it as it is pumped through the pipes.
