A recently rediscovered a recipe I submitted to the Standlake Primary School recipe book of 1979/80.
  
I don't use margarine anymore so swapped it out in favour of butter.  
  
170g (6oz) Plain Flour  
115g (4oz) Margarine  
55g (2oz) Cocoa  
120ml (0.25 PT) Milk  
115g (4oz) Golden syrup  
115g (4oz) Soft Brown sugar  
1 Egg  
1 1/2 level teaspoon bicarbonate of soda  

Sift the flour bicarb and cocoa together into a bowl.  
Add syrup, sugar and margarine to a pan and heat gently stirring constantly until melted.  
Add to the flour with the beaten egg, milk and bicarb.  
Stir until mixture is smooth. 

Bake in a greased and lined shallow tin 7.5 inch X 12 inch tin for 20 -25 minutes 190&deg;C (380&deg;F) gas mark 5.  
Or make 24 fairy cakes or in a pudding basin (at 175&deg;C, 350&deg;F for longer)
