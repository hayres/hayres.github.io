The freshening wind has allowed Alex Thomson to wring out more speed at a great wind angle to leap from 8th to 3rd in 1 sched. Boss’s metrics on the tracker show her traveling at 20kts, faster than all the other boats on the race track.</p> <p>If anyone is going to really get...<br/>

It was a surprise when Boss gybed away from the drag race to the Canaries and Alex ended up in the kind of no mans land where you just drift back into the same area of the rest of the fleet but behind the leader.

I was convinced that one day I would go there and take part. The novel also describes the bull fight that happens after....<br/>
