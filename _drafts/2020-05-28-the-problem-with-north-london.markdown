The problem is she may seem like a great writer but she has the best, and we are talking world class best, pillocks to take pot shots at.
And it would be funny if it wasn't so bloody tragically serious.
Again it it is the North London set with the writing positions at the Spectator and the ability to pull down large amounts of cash out of mid air to fuel their elite lifestyle that is making the rest of the world (you, me, our friends and family) feel miserable.
Blair and Campbell done it and if Cummings and his wife were 20 years older they would be up to their neck in Dodgy Dossiers. These people don't have political ideal or principals, they align themselves to who they think can accelerate their career and wealth gathering.
And this article should be the end of it. But Kuensberg, Peston and Rigby will keep hammering on and on because they have the scent of blood (which I don't believe they will get).
I was furious with Stephen Kinnock and his lockdown breaking 180 mile Journey from the Valleys to his parents North London home on 28th March to wish his Dad a happy 78th Birthday. He brazenly published pictures on twitter. As did his wife a former prime minister of Denmark who really should know better.
But they are not being doorstepped. Why not? He is an elected member of parliament. He should be above all reproach. But it does not suite the media because he just isn't in power.
My dad was 90 on 4th May. I spoke to him on the telephone as there was no zoom call due to him isolating properly to not burden the NHS and he does not have PC.
And that is because I am a responsible person with no aspirations of political power or financial gain from the state.
And besides, the north London streets are full of dog shit and press photographers so why the hell would you want to live there.
