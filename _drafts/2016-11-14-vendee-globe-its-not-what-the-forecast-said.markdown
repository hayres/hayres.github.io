Typically in sailing ther comes a time when the forecast says one thing but mother nature does another.
At the 17:00 report of the 2016 Vendee Globe it looked as though  Brit  [Alex Thomson](http://www.alexthomsonracing.com/) had stolrn a march on his 
fellow competitors and squeezed through the narrowest of corridors in the doldrums.  In fact Alex himself released a vlog last night where he relayed how
happy he was to be out of the "mess" and looking toward the south east trades.

However through the night it became obvious on the tracker that Hugo Boss had slowed up considerable against the other boats and at least to PRB and Banque Populaire
there had been some compression.  Behind those to boats the others have had a real fight on ther hands to stay in the hunt.

At the 0400UTC report Boss was down to 65nm ahead.  Still very significant.  There are however a couple of reasons why Boss could be going slower.
They could have been in less wind. But more likely is the design of the yacht itself.
The New Foiling wings that these boats carry are much more horizontal on Hugo Boss than the other boats.
In fact PRB has no foiling type foils but normal dagger boards.  This gives them much more lift in the conditions that they have been sailing in but no help at all
when the boats speed drops to below 10kts.  Whatch the excellent interview at the end of this post to find out more.
 
By the 0800UTC report the dust had somewhat settled and the lead was steady at about 60nm over the second 2 boats.  It looks as though they had a good passage as well.
I expect Thomsons lead to grow over the next 24 hours as he arrives to the increasing wind first.
