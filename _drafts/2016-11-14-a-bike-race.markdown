Amazing!  As a lover of all things bikes and bike racing I had, until last weekend never 
competed in a mountain bike race.

A few years back I got on my road bike, hit the turbo ever night, lost 2 stone and competed in some circuit racing at Castle Coombe.
That season ended and the next year early in April I time hit the local time trial circuit.  That also went well until suddenly work life balance tipped the wrong way
and I felt that i did have enough in me to deal with both properly.

Fast forward 4 or 5 years and I know live in the New Forest and have done way more mountain biking than road biking in the last 12 months.
The place just lends itself to it (although some of the locals don't agree). 
 
Now my 8 year old son has become hooked on mountain bikes and trials bikes.  His hero's are Danny MacAskill, Dan, Gee and Rachel Atherton. 
So he wanted to do the kids race at the New Forest XC.  A late season event that was being held at Avon Tyrell on the 13 November. 
We loaded the bikes on the car an I half hearted threw some kit in the back of the Disco.  
 
When we arrived we discovered that sadly the kids race had been cancelled. So I took him around the main course.
This for an 8 year old was tough.  But a load of fun.
